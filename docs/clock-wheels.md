# Clock Wheels (Format Clocks) – Project Document

This document describes the **targets**, **phases**, **current implementation status**, and **next steps** for the Clock Wheels feature in this AzuraCast custom codebase.

## Targets (what the feature must do)

### Broadcast / Programming goals
- **Build 60‑minute format clocks** that place content anchors inside the hour (IDs, ads, promos, sweepers, music, talk, etc.).
- **Strict structure, flexible content**:
  - Structure: anchors like TOH, :20, :35, :50.
  - Flexibility: which exact tracks/liners run varies to avoid repetition.
- **Professional on‑air output**:
  - Default behavior should **avoid cutting** songs/long-form elements mid‑play.
  - The system should use **real durations (to the second)** to choose items that fit upcoming anchors.
- **Multiple wheels** per station and **assign wheels to days/shows** using the station schedule calendar.
- **If a clock wheel cannot resolve content**, it should **fall back** to normal AzuraCast AutoDJ rotation.

### Scheduling rules (client requirement)
- **Must-schedule**: a clock wheel only runs when it has at least one schedule entry on the station calendar (inactive wheels may exist without schedules).
- **No overlaps**: if anything else is scheduled (playlist/streamer/other wheel) in that window, the clock wheel must **not** take effect.
- Clock wheels should only run in **explicitly scheduled windows** and must **respect the calendar** (dates, recurrence, overnight, play-once windows).

### Technical goals
- Delivered as **PR-ready code inside the existing Docker containers** (no external service required).
- Touches:
  - PHP (Slim + Doctrine)
  - Vue/Vite frontend
  - Schedule/calendar UI
- **PSR-compliant PHP**, follow existing `phpcs`/`phpstan` standards used by the repo.

### Acceptance (definition of done)
1. A user can:
   - Build a 60-minute wheel with anchors,
   - Save it,
   - Assign it to a station/time window,
   - Observe logs proving the correct rotation.
2. No regressions: existing AzuraCast behavior remains intact and standard tests pass.

## Phases (roadmap)

### Phase 0 — Foundations (already present in this codebase)
- Clock wheel entities + API scaffolding.
- Clock wheels appear in station UI.

### Phase 1 — Calendar dashboard + timed anchors + core playback planning (**implemented now**)
Goal: make wheels schedulable in the calendar and make playback **time-aware**.

Delivered items in this repo:
- **Timed slot anchors** (`position_seconds` 0–3599).
- **Schedule conflict prevention** (no overlapping scheduled windows).
- **Clock-wheel playback planner** that chooses items based on:
  - current second into hour
  - next anchor window
  - track duration (seconds)
  - duplicate prevention
  - algorithm choice (random/oldest/etc.)
  - optional playlist pin; **type** (required) filter on media
- **Unified schedule dashboard** that displays playlist + clock wheel events and supports creating events.

### Phase 2 — UX improvements (recommended next)
Goal: make “tweaks on the fly” extremely fast and reduce operator errors.
- Visual “wheel” editor (drag/resize blocks) backed by `position_seconds`.
- Per-slot validation + warnings:
  - overlapping anchors, impossible windows, too-small gaps
  - “no media fits this slot” preview warnings
- Better “preview hour” / “dry run” screen.

### Phase 3 — Hardening + tests + production guardrails (required before wide deployment)
Goal: ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- Automated tests for:
  - conflict checker (weekly/monthly/overnight)
  - planner slot selection and “fit-to-window” behavior
- Improve runtime fallback logging/metrics.
- Verify Docker upgrade/migration flow for existing installs.

### Phase 4 — Playback enforcement (implemented: PR8)
Two automatic layers — **no operator toggle** between “PHP only” and Liquidsoap:

1. **PHP (always):** duration-aware track selection in `ClockWheelPlaybackPlanner` (fit before next anchor, strict vs flexible rules).
2. **AutoDJ / Liquidsoap (fallback):** when selection alone cannot guarantee timing, the planner sets `clock_wheel_enforce_cap` on the queue row and `ClockWheelAnnotator` applies **`cue_out`** through the normal annotation path (no manual `ls_config`).

**When the fallback runs**

| Situation | `clock_wheel_enforce_cap` |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Schedule **strict** | Yes — hard stop at anchor |
| Short-form slot (ID / promo / ad / slot `duration_seconds`) | Yes |
| Schedule **flexible** + music/talk that **fits** the window | No — play naturally |
| Schedule **flexible** + music/talk with **no fitting track** (shortest overflow) | Yes — cut at anchor |

**Per schedule row** (`clock_wheel_mode` on clock wheel calendar events only):

- `flexible`: prefer full songs; overflow + short slots trigger fallback caps.
- `strict`: must fit at selection time; fallback cap at every anchor for safety.

**Not used:** playlist `loop_once` on clock wheel schedules; no `loop_once` UI for clock wheels.

### PR8 Phase 2 — playback paths, monitoring, and deferred liq work

#### How audio reaches the listener

Clock wheels are **not** generated in Liquidsoap config. Playback is always orchestrated in PHP, then delivered to Liquidsoap through the normal AutoDJ API.

```text
BuildQueue (sync) → ClockWheelScheduler → ClockWheelPlaybackPlanner → station_queue
Liquidsoap nextsong → AnnotateNextSong (asAutoDj) → ClockWheelAnnotator (cue_out when capped)
```

| Path | Clock wheel metadata | PR8 duration cap |
|------|----------------------|------------------|
| **AutoDJ queue → `nextsong`** (designed path) | Yes (`clock_wheel_id` on queue/history) | Yes — `clock_wheel_enforce_cap` + `autocue_cue_out` |
| **Liquidsoap fallback** when queue is empty (`autodj_fallback`, `standard_playlists`, `playlist_default`) | No | No |
| **Static playlist `.m3u`** (`PlaylistFileWriter`, `asAutoDj: false`) | No | No |

The overview **Now** badge reflects the **schedule** only. Confirm the **Upcoming Queue** lists wheel rows and Liquidsoap `nextsong` returns **200** during the window.

#### Short-form slots near the next anchor (implemented)

When an ID / promo / ad slot has **less time left than any file length** (e.g. 18 seconds until the next anchor, 4-minute promo on disk), the planner now behaves like flexible music overflow:

- Picks the **shortest** candidate of the correct type.
- Sets **`clock_wheel_enforce_cap`** so `ClockWheelAnnotator` applies **`cue_out`** at the anchor.
- Under **strict** schedule mode, if nothing fits and strict rules apply, the slot may still return no track (no overflow).

#### Production monitoring (recommended)

Watch during active wheel windows:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Clock Wheel "…" is active` in `app_nowplaying-*.log` | Scheduler engaged |
| `Clock Wheel resolved track` | Planner queued a wheel row |
| `Queue builder error` / `SQLSTATE` | Queue build failed — fix before relying on wheel |
| Liquidsoap `Queue is empty!` on every `nextsong` | No queue rows — likely fallback to default playlist |
| `Switch to standard_playlists` / `playlist_default` in LS logs | On-air from static rotation, not AutoDJ wheel |
| Feedback with only `playlist_id`, no wheel in queue UI | Fallback or normal AutoDJ, not wheel |

Log files (inside container): `/var/azuracast/www_tmp/app_nowplaying-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, station Liquidsoap logs under `/var/azuracast/stations/`.

#### Deferred (optional — not required for launch)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **`ConfigWriter` `max_duration`** for clock wheels | **Not implemented** | Entity doc mentions a future liq generator; there is no clock-wheel block in `.liq` today. PR8 uses PHP `cue_out` on the AutoDJ path instead. Rule if added later: only when `duration_seconds` is set on the slot; never on flexible music. |
| **`PlaylistFileWriter` clock-wheel-aware** | **Not needed** for the designed path | Only relevant if you must cap tracks played from static `.m3u` during a wheel window. |
| **Block Liquidsoap fallback during wheel** | **Not implemented** | Would need liq/config changes to prefer empty air over default playlist when queue is empty. |
| **Planner drift vs wall clock** | **Known edge** | Rebuild interval and metadata length can shift anchor adherence slightly. |

## What is implemented *right now* (in `Azura-Cast-Custom-GitRepo`)

### Backend
- **Migration**: added `station_clock_wheel_slots.position_seconds`.
  - File: `backend/src/Entity/Migration/Version20260519120000.php`
  - Backfill behavior: spreads legacy slots at ~5-minute intervals using `slot_order * 300`.
- **Entity updates**:
  - `StationClockWheelSlot` now has `position_seconds` and slots are ordered by `position_seconds, slot_order`.
  - Files:
    - `backend/src/Entity/StationClockWheelSlot.php`
    - `backend/src/Entity/StationClockWheel.php`
- **Clock wheel scheduling & playback**:
  - `ClockWheelPlaybackPlanner` chooses the active slot by second-in-hour and resolves a track that fits before the next anchor.
  - Files:
    - `backend/src/Radio/AutoDJ/ClockWheel/ClockWheelPlaybackPlanner.php`
    - `backend/src/Radio/AutoDJ/ClockWheelScheduler.php`
- **Calendar conflict prevention**:
  - A conflict checker prevents overlap between scheduled playlists/streamers/clock wheels.
  - Integrated into schedule writes.
  - Files:
    - `backend/src/Radio/Schedule/ScheduleConflictChecker.php`
    - `backend/src/Entity/Repository/StationScheduleRepository.php`
- **Clock wheel schedule feed now supports calendar click-to-edit**:
  - Adds `edit_url` to the clock wheel schedule events.
  - File: `backend/src/Controller/Api/Stations/ClockWheels/ClockWheelsController.php`

### Playback metadata (station UI + API)
- Queue rows and song history store `clock_wheel_id` when AutoDJ picks a track from a clock wheel.
- Now Playing, Upcoming Queue, and Reports → Timeline show **Clock Wheel: {name}** in the source/metadata area (same pattern as playlist).
- Station profile **Scheduled** panel lists upcoming clock wheel windows with type **Clock Wheel**.

### Frontend
- **Unified Schedule page** that shows multiple sources (playlists + clock wheels).
  - File: `frontend/components/Stations/Schedule.vue`
- **ScheduleCalendar component** supporting multiple event sources + create button.
  - File: `frontend/components/Stations/Common/ScheduleCalendar.vue`
- **Clock wheel editor** supports schedule items and timed anchors.
  - Files:
    - `frontend/components/Stations/ClockWheels/EditModal.vue`
    - `frontend/components/Stations/ClockWheels/Form/Entries.vue`
    - `frontend/components/Stations/ClockWheels/Form/Schedule.vue`
- **Create Event modal** supports clock wheel events with **Flexible / Strict** (`clock_wheel_mode`); playlist-only **Flexible / Strict / Loop Once** remain for playlists.
  - File: `frontend/components/Stations/Common/CreateEventModal.vue`
- **PR8 fallback caps** via `ClockWheelAnnotator` when `station_queue.clock_wheel_enforce_cap` is set (no admin mode switch).
  - Files: `ClockWheelPlaybackPlanner.php`, `ClockWheelAnnotator.php`

### Tests (PHPUnit / Codeception)
- Date range overlap helper: `tests/Unit/ScheduleConflictDateRangeTest.php`
- Schedule conflict checker (weekly/monthly/overnight, playlist vs wheel): `tests/Unit/ScheduleConflictCheckerTest.php`
- Planner anchor math + media query by `storage_location` (regression for invalid `sl.stations` DQL): `tests/Unit/ClockWheelPlaybackPlannerTest.php`
- Clock wheel schedule activation (overnight, play-once, window boundaries): `tests/Unit/ClockWheelScheduleActivationTest.php`
- AutoDJ `ClockWheelScheduler` (skip/active/resolve/fall-through): `tests/Unit/ClockWheelSchedulerTest.php`
- PR8 `ClockWheelAnnotator` (`cue_out` caps): `tests/Unit/ClockWheelAnnotatorTest.php`
- PR8 planner caps and short-form overflow: `tests/Unit/ClockWheelPlaybackPlannerTest.php` (`shouldEnforcePlaybackCap`, `filterByDuration`)
- Clock wheel API (CRUD, overlap rejection, slots, schedule feed): `tests/Functional/Api_Stations_ClockWheelsCest.php`
- Manual dev script only (not CI): `util/test_clock_wheels.sh`

## Known limitations / gaps (to address next)

- **Planner timeline** now uses `expectedPlayTime` plus unplayed queue rows in the same hour (`getPlannedSecondsIntoHour`). Remaining edge case: actual on-air drift vs metadata duration until the next queue rebuild.
  - This is good enough for basic anchors but needs refinement if you want strict adherence across drift scenarios.
- **Schedule conflict detection** currently uses a **fixed validation window** (90 days) for recurrence expansion.
  - This is intentional for performance but should be configurable and well-tested.
- **Front-end typed schedule row import**: the clock wheel edit modal currently reuses the playlist schedule row type.
  - This is fine for now but should be cleaned up for long-term maintainability.
- **CI** does not run Codeception on PRs yet (image build only); run `composer run codeception` locally or in Docker before release.
- **Still light coverage:** `hasNonClockWheelScheduleActive` runtime integration, Liquidsoap fallback paths, frontend timeline UI (no JS test suite).

## Required next steps (recommended order)

### 1) Fix and harden current changes
- Run PHP lint/format/static analysis in the container CI environment (`phpcs`, `phpstan`).
- API/schedule tests added (see Tests section above); run `composer run codeception` in Docker to verify.

### 2) Improve conflict checker correctness — **done**
- Dedicated unit suite: `tests/Unit/ScheduleConflictCheckerTest.php`
  - weekly vs monthly recurrence
  - overnight windows
  - boundary behavior (end == start)
  - “play once” items
  - cross-entity conflicts (playlist vs clock wheel)

### 3) Improve planner (professionalism) — **done (core)**
- Fixed anchor math: position within hour (0–3599), not seconds since midnight.
- Planned timeline: `getPlannedSecondsIntoHour()` uses `expectedPlayTime` + queued items in the same hour.
- Per-slot minimum window before deferring (music/talk/short-form).
- Unit tests: `tests/Unit/ClockWheelPlaybackPlannerTest.php`

### 4) UX upgrade for fast edits — **timeline list done**
- Hour timeline bar with clickable anchors (`frontend/components/Stations/ClockWheels/Form/Entries.vue`).
- Drag-to-reorder rows (preserves anchor times, reassigns to new order).
- Duplicate / insert-after actions; overlap/gap warnings.
- Optional later: full circular drag/resize wheel UI (same `position_seconds` backend).

## Operational validation (how to check it works)
- Create a wheel with anchors:
  - 0:00 ID
  - 20:00 Ad
  - 35:00 Promo
  - 50:00 ID
- Set **Type** on media files (ID / promo / ad / music) on the Music Files page.
- Schedule the wheel on **Schedule → Create Event** (not only “Active” on the wheel form).
- Schedule it for a station window where nothing else is scheduled.
- Confirm **Upcoming Queue** shows wheel rows during the window.
- Watch `app_nowplaying-*.log` (see **PR8 Phase 2 — production monitoring** above):
  - “Clock Wheel … is active”
  - “Clock Wheel slot selection … seconds_into_hour … available_seconds …”
  - “Clock Wheel resolved track … effective_length …”
  - No repeating `Queue builder error` or Liquidsoap `Queue is empty!`
- Create an overlapping playlist schedule in the same window:
  - verify the save is **blocked**
  - and/or at runtime the wheel is **skipped** and normal AutoDJ runs
